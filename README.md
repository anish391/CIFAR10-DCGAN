# CIFAR10-DCGAN

The aim of this project is to use two types of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), specifically Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs) and Self Attention GANs (SAGANs) in order to learn input image data distribution and generate real looking images. Here, we learn image data distribution of the 10 classes present in CIFAR-10 dataset and hope to generate images similar to that of the dataset.
